# neural_networks_project
This repo is for UT course Neural Networks (LTAT.02.001) project **Training and validating end-to-end models in real-life based on self-driving car simulator data.**

The models and data preprocessing is done in Google Colab and the .ipynb files will be saved to the github repository. Currently the files are found from here -> https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o3y_BVoB0hzQFF6lVP5e0jVVkeJh4FJI.
