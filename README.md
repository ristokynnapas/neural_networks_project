# neural_networks_project
This repo is for UT course Neural Networks (LTAT.02.001) project **Training and validating end-to-end models in real-life based on self-driving car simulator data.**

Some part of this project work is listed in the lidar_branch and is used actively in the development phase. If code is working and contributes to the overall project this will be merged with **main branch**.
